# How it Works
The Movie Recommender System employs content-based filtering to recommend movies similar to those a user has liked in the past. It analyzes the textual features of movies such as genre, plot summaries, and other descriptive attributes. By vectorizing this textual data, the system can suggest movies with similar characteristics to those a user has shown interest in.
